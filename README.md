# Diamond Price Predictor App using Streamlit #

## By: Nate DiRenzo ##

### Statement of Purpose ###

The purpose of this repository is as a tutorial for creating a regression model that predicts the price of a diamond, and building a simple frontend application to make the model publicly available using Streamlit.

### Data Description ###

The data we will be using for this project is the [Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds) dataset, which is publicly available via Kaggle. It contains 53940 observations, and 10 features in the dataset.

### Tools ###

- **Pandas** for accessing the data, and preparing the it for modeling.

- **XGBoost** for creating a gradient-boosted regression model.

- **Streamlit** for creating a frontend application
